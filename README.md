# Wifi-Password-Viewer-V1.0
This is an awesome Wifi Password Viewer for those who forgot their wifi password that was once connected to their PC. This app still works even if the Wifi was connected years ago. Just run the app as administrator and the app will automatically do it's job.

Update: I have also given the "ZIP" file of my python program. This ZIP file is only for those who are facing problem with the single "EXE" file. You can choose to use either ZIP file or EXE file (It's your choice) but if one doesn't work then please try the another one because the another will definately work.
Reason To Do This is because different OS (Windows 7/8/10) have different requirements so for my program to run smoothly in every OS, I intentionally did this. Thank You.
